## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a communication network between two ESP8266 microcontroller boards, designed as IoT devices for personal use. Each device hosts its own website, allowing users to log in, update configurations, and view real-time data shared between the two devices. The system is equipped with several interactive features, including:

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Interface**: Reads messages aloud between the devices.
- **RGB LED**: Indicates the user's emotion or status based on predefined color schemes.
- **SSD1306 OLED Screen**: Displays animations corresponding to user actions.

### Security and Testing

In addition to its core functionality, this project serves as a personal Capture The Flag (CTF) and red-teaming exercise. By conducting penetration tests and simulating potential attack scenarios, I have been able to identify and address security vulnerabilities. These tests help improve the system's overall security by focusing on areas such as secure communication protocols, encryption, and authentication.

### Future Plans

Future enhancements for the project include:

- **SQL Database Integration**: Replacing local EEPROM memory with a centralized SQL database for improved data security and scalability.
- **OAuth Authentication**: Adding OAuth support to secure login and ensure only authorized access.
- **Custom Battery & Charging Interface**: Designing a power system to allow the devices to run independently on battery power.

### Skills Involved

This project has helped me develop and strengthen a variety of technical skills, including:

- **Programming Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python
- **Technologies**: RTOS development, IoT security practices
- **Hardware Design**: PCB design, battery and charging systems
- **Security**: Penetration testing, red-teaming techniques, encryption, secure protocols

This project combines personal creativity and technical challenge, while also being a useful gift for my girlfriend and me to enjoy. It is an ongoing learning experience, continuously evolving to improve functionality, security, and usability.
